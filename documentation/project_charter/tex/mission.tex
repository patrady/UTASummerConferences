Our mission is to replace the old system followed by UTA Summer Conferences with a full stack web application which they can access from any machine on UTA Campus. Our goal is to build an application that manages all aspects of summer camps and conferences, viz. booking requests, billing, equipment, check-in & check-out, parking, linens, room reservations, etc. We will provide an easy to use UI which communicates with the backend database via API requests.
