UTA Summer Conferences hosts close to 100 camps over the summer. They have a revenue loss of approximately $50,000 every summer because of the current system of loosely tied applications and human error in using those applications. By providing a streamlined one-stop solution for them to manage all the tasks, from requesting to host a camp to billing, we would save a lot of time and money of the department.
